<h1 id="business-context">Business context</h1>
<p>OTT (Over-the-Top) media services deliver content directly to viewers
via the internet, bypassing traditional TV. These platforms, offering
on-demand video and music, are becoming increasingly popular due to
their convenience and better digital connectivity. The global OTT
market, valued at $121.61 billion in 2019, is projected to reach
$1,039.03 billion by 2027, growing rapidly at a 29.4% CAGR. The shift
from traditional broadcasting to OTT services has accelerated,
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a 46% increase in
consumption. Ongoing innovations in OTT platforms are expected to
further attract and retain subscribers globally. ShowTime is a growing
OTT company. To address the current objectives, our focus is on
identifying the key drivers of first-day content viewership. By
understanding these factors, we can implement strategies to enhance
viewer engagement on the platform. Possible reasons for the recent
decline in viewership include decreased platform traffic, reduced
marketing investments, scheduling conflicts, and variations due to
weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>In our role as Data Scientists for ShowTime company, we will analyze
the data to develop a linear regression model. This model will help us
uncover the significant factors influencing first-day viewership and
provide actionable insights to improve content performance and platform
engagement.</p>

</div>
<p>We have been provided with a content views record for each show
released. The data set which we have used to generate this report has
following features. visitors : which is a numerical variable for number
of customers in millions that engaged in the platform past week prior to
show release. Ad impressions : a numerical variable for number of ads
invested in millions across all ad campaigns for the content both
running and completed. Major sports event : a categorical variable
having values 0 or 1 to show whether on the day of release there was a
major sports event. Genre : the category of show released for e.g Scifi,
action, romance etc. Day of week : a string field for the day of release
of the content. Season : in which season the content was released.
Trailer views : a numerical variable for number of views in millions of
the content trailer prior to show released. Lastly content views : a
numerical variable for the number of first-day views in millions of the
content. Figure <a href="#fig:dataset" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dataset">[fig:dataset]</a> shows a snap shot of the
data set used in this analysis. In total we have 8 columns/fields and
1000 records/rows.</p>
<p>Our aim is to study these variables and find any relationship between
these variables or some pattern to give us business insights and help us
with strengthening business strategies. One of the most important aspect
of data analysis is making sure that we have valid data set. For this we
perform data cleaning and look for any irregularities and outliers in
the data set which can negatively impact our analysis. Fortunately we
did not find any missing or null values in our data set. No duplicated
records were found. We checked unique values for each categorical
variables and we did not find any irregularities or typos. To have a
idea about outliers in our data set we have checked boxplots for each
numerical variables. We observed that there are presence of many
outliers. figure <a href="#fig:outlier" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:outlier">1</a> shows box plot for trailer and
content views. But we did not treat or remove these outliers as all the
records are a valid observations corresponding to some show release.</p>

<p>In the analysis we have studied distribution of all the numerical as
well as categorical values which is important to find any irregularities
or bias in the data set. Figure <a
href="#fig: Distribution of numerical variables "
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig: Distribution of numerical variables ">[fig:
Distribution of numerical variables ]</a> shows plot for distribution of
all numerical variables. We observe that number of visitors to the
platform prior to show release vary from 1.2 million to 2.2 million with
a mean visit of 1.7 millions. The distribution is shown in figure <a
href="#fig:visit distribution" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:visit distribution">2</a>. The distribution for
number of ad impressions invested is shown in figure <a
href="#fig:ad_impression distribution" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:ad_impression distribution">3</a>. Figure <a
href="#fig:trailer_views dist" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:trailer_views dist">4</a> shows the trailer views
distribution where we find there is a strong peak around 60 million
views. The plot looks like a vary narrow normal distribution. But there
are many outliers and data has strong spread to right up to 200 million
views. Figure <a href="#fig: content_views dist"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: content_views dist">5</a>
shows distribution of content views. It roughly looks like a normal
distribution but with right skewness. The values vary from 0.2 to 0.9
million views with a mean of 0.47 million and a standard deviation of
0.1 million.</p>

shows distribution of genre of show released and the day of week on
which show released for our data set. We observe in figure <a
href="#fig:genre dist" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:genre dist">6</a>that all the genres have roughly
same number of shows around 100 in our data set. This is a positive
factor for our analysis as we don’t want the distribution in our data
set to get biased towards any particular genre. In figure <a
href="#fig:dayofweek dist" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dayofweek dist">7</a> we find that more than 60% of
the shows are released on Friday and Wednesday.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:day and season effect" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:day and season effect">[fig:day and season

day of week and season on which the show is released. We observe that
shows released on Saturday has highest median first day viewership. But
as shown in figure <a href="#fig:content_views_vs_dayofweek"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:content_views_vs_dayofweek">8</a>, it is worth while
to note that all the box plots have outliers and the difference with
respect to day of release is not big. most of them have median values
around 0.45 million views. Figure <a href="#fig:content_views_vs_season"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:content_views_vs_season">9</a> shows content views
distribution with respect to seasons. Shows released in summer have
highest number of median first day views.</p>

<figure>
<img src="content_views_vs_season.png"

</figure>
<p>It is important also to note that there are other factors in play
here. Presence of major sports event on day of show release has strong
influence on content views on the first day as shown in figure <a
href="#fig:Effect of major sports event on content view"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Effect of major sports event on content view">[fig:Effect
of major sports event on content view]</a>. On the left box plot for
content views with respect to presence of major sport event shows that
the median value first day viewership get lower. This happens with all
kind of genres as shown on right <a
href="#fig:views_count_sports_event_genre.png" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:views_count_sports_event_genre.png">11</a>. Also we
noticed that in summer there is less number of major sports event as
shown in figure <a href="#fig:sports_vs_season"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sports_vs_season">12</a>.
So it could be a interlinked reason for the highest number of views for
shows released in summer.</p>

is the correlation between trailer views and content views?</h2>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:corr" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:corr">13</a> we have plotted the correlation among
all the numerical variables. We observe that there is a weak correlation
of 0.26 between number visitors to the platform on previous week and
content views and a strong correlation of 0.75 between trailer views and
content views. To further illustrate we have shown a scatter plot
between them on figure <a href="#fig:content_vs_trailer"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:content_vs_trailer">14</a>. This gives a strong
impression for linear relationship between trailer views and content
views. We observe that there is practically very weak correlation among
predictor variables. This is a good sign when we will consider building
linear model in the coming section. One more important point note here
is that the correlation between ad impressions and content views is very
weak 0.05. This hints us towards lack of effectiveness in the ad
campaigns in influencing customers for the up coming shows. For a
successful ad campaign we would want a strong positive correlation.</p>

<h1 id="linear-regression-model">Linear Regression model</h1>
<p>In this section we will describe the implementation of Linear
regression model on our content views data set. As we had already seen
in the figure <a href="#fig:content_vs_trailer"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:content_vs_trailer">14</a>
there is a graphical impression of linear dependence between content
views and trailer views. Being the simplest and most popular model we
will implement it with respect to all independent variables. Here our
target variable is content views and all other variables are
independent/predictor variables. We will proceed with assumption that
linear dependency is a good description of target variable in terms of
predictor variables. More precisely our model equation has following
form: <span class="math display">\[\hat{y}=\sum_i \beta_i.X_i +
C\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> is the
target variable we want to predict. <span
class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> are predictor/independent variables
with <span class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> as coefficients. C is
the intercept which is the value of target variable when all independent
variables are zero. epsilon is the noise or error term So we are
expressing target variable as a linear combination of independent
variables. We used ordinary least square method for the regression. Mean
while it is important to note that here calculating <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span>s from sample data are an
estimation of population parameter/coefficients. We assume that the data
are drawn from population in following manner: <span
class="math display">\[\hat{y}=\sum_i \beta^{pop}_i.X_i + C^{pop} +
\epsilon\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is
the error or noise term which is assumed to normally distributed.
Therefore the calculation of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> from sample data is the
estimation of population coefficients <span
class="math inline">\(\beta^{pop}_i\)</span>. The assumptions of linear
regression are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We assume there is a linear relationship between target and
independent variable. More precisely the data are drawn from population
according to equation 2 and expectation value of error term i.e <span
class="math inline">\(E(\epsilon)\)</span> = 0 and <span
class="math inline">\(E(y)\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i
\beta^{pop}_i.X_i + C^{pop}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The error terms are independent for each target variable
value.</p></li>
<li><p>The error terms are normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>Homoscedasticity: The error terms have equal variance for each
target variable.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no strong multicollinearity among independent
variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="wrapfigure">
<p><span>R</span><span>0.25</span> <img src="VIF.png"
style="width:25.0%" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>In a sentence we can say about the assumptions as : error terms <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> are independent Normal random
variable with mean zero and constant variance. During model
implementation we check for validity of all these assumptions. We now
describe one of the most important step in predictive modeling which is
features preparation or feature engineering. As we have categorical
values in our data set we can not use them directly in the regression
which requires numerical variables. So we convert them to numerical
values by creating dummy variable for each categorical variable with
number of new variables being one less than number of unique categories.
So these dummy variables have now a value of 1 or 0 corresponding to
true or false value for that category value. We divide the data set into
70:30 ratio subsets for training and testing respectively. So out of
1000 data records we use 700 for training and 300 for testing and the
sampling is done randomly. On our first trial we tried the model using
all the independent variables. On the result we got a R-squared value of
0.7916 and root mean squared error(RMSE) value of 0.0485. <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is a measure of how strong is the
linear relationship. So 79.16 % of variance in the target variable is
explained by this model in terms of predictor variables. To ensure that
there is no multicollinearity among predictors we checked the variance
inflation factor VIF for each variable. Figure <a href="#fig:VIF"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:VIF">[fig:VIF]</a> shows
the list of VIF for all variables. As a generally followed rule If VIF
is 1, then there is no correlation among the <span
class="math inline">\(k^{th}\)</span> predictor and the remaining
predictor variables, and hence, the variance of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_k\)</span> is not inflated at all. If VIF
exceeds 5, we say there is moderate VIF, and if it is 10 or exceeding
10, it shows signs of high multi-collinearity. Ignoring the intercept
which is a constant all other variables have VIF less than 5. Therefore
our model does not have multicollinearity. Hereby we have validated the
assumption corresponding to multicollinearity.</p>
<p>The p values in the fit result (<span class="math inline">\(P &gt;
|t|\)</span>) are interpreted in the following ways. For each predictor
variable there is a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis. Null
hypothesis : Predictor variable is not significant Alternate hypothesis
: Predictor variable is significant (<span class="math inline">\(P &gt;
|t|\)</span>) gives the p-value for each predictor variable to check the
null hypothesis. If the level of significance is set to 5% (0.05), the
p-values greater than 0.05 would indicate that the corresponding
predictor variables are not significant. We found the p values for ad
impressions, and genre variables and day of week Tuesday variable
significantly higher than 0.05. Therefore we have removed these
predictors from our final linear model. The coefficients from fit
results of final model are shown in figure <a href="#fig:coeff"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:coeff">15</a>. The model
performance on the training and test data set is shown in figure <a
href="#fig:final model performance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:final model performance">[fig:final model
performance]</a>. To test the independence of residuals or error terms
we have shown fitted vs residual plot on figure <a
href="#fig:Fitted_Vs_Residual" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Fitted_Vs_Residual">20</a>. The random scattering of
residual around x axis shows that our assumption on Linearity dependence
of target variable and independence of residuals are valid. To test the
normality of error term we have plotted distribution of residuals on
figure <a href="#fig: normality check" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig: normality check">[fig: normality check]</a> and a
Q-Q plot which is a comparison of quantile by quantile with respect to
the normal distribution. The distribution of residuals closely look like
a normal distribution but with a longer right tail. The deviation on
both tails are visible on the Q-Q plot.</p>

</figure>
<p>We also carried out Shapiro-Wilk test for testing the validity of
normality. We got a p value of 0.3 which is not sufficient to reject the
null hypothesis that distribution is normal. Hence our assumption of
normality is valid. For the test of constant variance we carried out the
Goldfeld–Quandt test which checks for heteroscedasticity in regression
analyses. We got a p value of 0.128 hence we can not reject the null
hypothesis that variances are equal. So all of the 5 assumptions are
valid in our model for practical purpose. As we see from figure <a
href="#fig:final model performance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:final model performance">[fig:final model
performance]</a>, we can see that RMSE on the train and test sets are
comparable. So, our model is not suffering from overfitting. R-squared
of the model is 0.761 and adjusted R-squared is 0.751, which shows that
the model is able to explain  75% variance in the data. The MAPE on the
test set suggests we can predict within 9.17% of the content views. This
can be considered a good model. This suggests that the model is
effective for both prediction and inference.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shows released on Saturday has highest first day viewership
followed by Wednesday, Sunday and the rest days.</p></li>
<li><p>Shows released in summer have higher content views.</p></li>
<li><p>Presence of major sports event on the day of show release
adversely affects viewership in all genres.</p></li>
<li><p>In summer there is lesser chance of clash with a major sports
event.</p></li>
<li><p>For each million visitors in the last week there are 0.129
million more content views when the show is released.</p></li>
<li><p>There is significant correlation between trailer views and
content views. For each million trailer views there are 0.0023 million
more content views with very high confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>The correlation between ad impression and content view is very
small. This shows ad campaign has been ineffective.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-recommendations">Business Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To increse chance of viewership release new content on
saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is an unavoidable sports event on the same day of
release, it is advised to change the day of release.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recommended to bring more content in summer probably
because there is less chance of collision with sports event in summer
and also there are vacations going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Take action to increase visitors on the OTT platform prior to a
new show release.</p></li>
<li><p>Invest more in making impressive trailers. Find improved methods
to increase trailer views prior to show release.</p></li>
<li><p>Advertisements have been ineffective. Take necessary actions and
consultations from ad department to increase influence of ads about new
show release across different platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>The linear model described in this report can explain 75% of the
story in the content view data set. It may be used for prediction,
planning and inferences.</p></li>

<p><span><strong>Trial of a model with log transformation of trailer
views:</strong></span><br />
From figure <a href="#fig:log_comparison" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:log_comparison">21</a> we observe that there is a
resemblance of plot between trailer and content views to that of a
logarithm plot. So we carried out a model where we took log
transformation of trailer views variable. On figure <a
href="#fig:log_performance" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:log_performance">23</a> we have shown the model
performance. Since the values are not very different from the models
where we did not take any transformations we did not proceed further
with this model. Nevertheless, this log model also gives good result on
training data similar to our final model.</p>
