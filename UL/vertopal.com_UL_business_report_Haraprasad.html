<h1 id="business-context">Business context</h1>
<p>AllLife Bank aims to enhance its credit card customer base in the
upcoming financial year. Insights from the marketing research team
suggest that market penetration can be improved. Consequently, the
Marketing team plans to launch personalized campaigns targeting new
customers and upselling to existing ones. Additionally, market research
revealed that customers perceive the bank’s support services poorly. In
response, the Operations team intends to upgrade the service delivery
model to ensure faster resolution of customer queries. Both the Head of
Marketing and Head of Delivery have decided to seek assistance from the
Data Science team to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>As a data scientist at AllLife Bank, my objective is to identify
distinct customer segments based on their spending patterns and past
interactions with the bank. By employing clustering algorithms, I aim to
uncover meaningful insights that will enable the bank to tailor its
marketing strategies and enhance customer service. My recommendations
will focus on how to effectively target new customers and up sell to
existing ones, ensuring a more personalized and efficient approach to
customer engagement.</p>
<h1 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory data analysis</h1>
<h2 id="data-set-description">Data set description</h2>
<p>The dataset provided includes information on various bank customers
and their financial attributes, such as credit limits and the total
number of credit cards they hold. It also details the different channels
through which customers have contacted the bank for queries, including
in-person visits, online interactions, and calls to the call center.</p>

<p>The data set consists of 660 records and 7 columns. I dropped two
columns which represented unique customers and Serial number. Not useful
for the analysis. After this we have 5 columns and all are numerical. No
missing value or irregular values were found. All the records were
unique. My motivation is to cluster these customers based on this five
dimensional data set.</p>

<p>I tried to investigate how number of cards and credit limit owned by
the customers varied with respect to how many times they contacted or
visited bank through different channels. Figure <a
href="#fig:Credit cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to online visits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Credit cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to online visits">[fig:Credit
cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to online
visits]</a> shows the Credit cards and average credit limits
distribution with respect to online visits. We observe that customer
visits higher than 6 have significantly higher number of credit cards
and limit. In fact from this plot we sort of get a glimpse into two
major clusters. Therefore online visit is a good segregate variable for
different customers group. Figure <a
href="#fig:Credit cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to Bank visits"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Credit cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to Bank visits">[fig:Credit
cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to Bank
visits]</a> shows the Credit cards and average credit limits
distribution with respect to Bank visits. We observe that the variation
is more pronounced for Total number of credit cards. Customers with
higher number of cards made more visits to Banks which is expected since
more the cards the more maintenance and services one might need. Similar
story is also observed for the Total calls made in case of Number of
credit cards as shown in figure <a
href="#fig:Credit cards and average credit limits distribution with respect to Number of calls made."

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:corrt" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:corrt">13</a> shows the heat map for the correlation
among five variables. Bank visits and Online visits are negatively
correlated with -0.55. This shows that customers using online
services/modes are less likely to visit the bank in person. we also
observe that number of credit cards and number of phone calls are
negatively correlated with -0.65. In contrast to this number of credit
cards is positively correlated to online visits. Customers with higher
credit cards and limit are more likely to use online methods.</p>
<h1 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h1>
<p>Data preprocessing is a crucial step in clustering to ensure that the
data is clean, consistent, and suitable for analysis. The data set did
not have any irregular or missing values. As for the outliers that we
found in credit limit and online visits, it would not have been a good
choice to remove these, since all of these records are valid and also no
instability was found during clustering implementation due to these
outliers which off course if described posterior to implementation.
Normalization of the data ensures that all features contribute equally
to the distance calculations. Common methods include Min-Max scaling and
Z-score normalization. I carried out the Z-score on all the five
features since the range of values for credit limit is significantly
higher than all other columns. This was necessary to avoid bias to any
particular feature. After the transformation the normalized dataset is
shown in distribution plot figure <a href="#fig:scaled_data"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:scaled_data">15</a>. We
see that all the features are now centered around the mean zero.</p>

<h1 id="k-means-clustering">K-means Clustering</h1>
<p>K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning
algorithm used to partition a dataset into distinct groups or clusters.
The goal is to divide the data points into k clusters, where each data
point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The steps involved
are as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initialization: Choose the number of clusters k and randomly
initialize k centroids.</p></li>
<li><p>Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based
on the Euclidean distance.</p></li>
<li><p>Update: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points
assigned to each cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the
centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of
iterations is reached.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The metric used here for the KMeans distance is Euclidean. To figure
out suitable K for the given data set I checked the Elbow method and
Silhouette score for different K. The Plot of the sum of squared
distances from each point to its assigned centroid (within-cluster sum
of squares) for different values of k is shown in figure <a
href="#fig:elbow" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:elbow">16</a>. The optimal k is often found at the
"elbow" point where the rate of decrease slows down. we observe that K
=3. Also along side we calculate the silhouette score for different K as
shown in figure <a href="#fig:sil_score" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:sil_score">17</a> and <a
href="#fig:Average distortion and Silhouette score across K."
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Average distortion and Silhouette score across K.">[fig:Average
distortion and Silhouette score across K.]</a>. Silhouette score
measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to
other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined
clusters. From this analysis we find that the optimal k for this data
set is 3. The Silhouette score is highest for k = 3 : 0.59. we chose the
final KMeans model with 3 clusters.</p>

<h1 id="hierarchical-clustering">Hierarchical Clustering</h1>
<p>Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to
build a hierarchy of clusters. It is particularly useful for identifying
nested clusters and understanding the structure of the data. There are
two main types of hierarchical clustering:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) Clustering: This approach starts with
each data point as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest
pairs of clusters until all points are in a single cluster or a desired
number of clusters is reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Divisive (Top-Down) Clustering: This approach starts with all
data points in a single cluster and iteratively splits the clusters into
smaller clusters until each data point is its own cluster or a desired
number of clusters is reached.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this analysis, I have used Agglomerative Clustering approach. To
figure out appropriate number of cluster for the data set I have used
the dendrogram which is a tree-like diagram that shows the arrangement
of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. Along side this I
have calculated The Cophonetic correlation coefficients for various
combination of metric and Linkage Methods. The cophenetic correlation
coefficient measures how faithfully the dendrogram preserves the
pairwise distances between the original data points. A higher cophenetic
correlation indicates that the dendrogram accurately reflects the
original data structure.</p>

Dendrograms with different linkage methods for Euclidean metric with at
least 0.8 of cophenetic correlation. From these reliable dendrograms it
is observed that 3 clusters would have been appropriate for the dataset
as beyond this the branches grew rapidly. So we chose the final
Hierarchical(HC) model with 3 clusters.</p>

<h1 id="comparison-between-two-techniques">Comparison between two
techniques</h1>
<p>The results from both clustering techniques KMeans and
Hierarchical(HC) are same both qualitatively and quantitatively. Both of
them gave 3 clusters with almost exact identity/properties, only cluster
1 and 2 were interchanged. This can be observed from Figure <a
href="#fig:Cluster Method Comparision" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Cluster Method Comparision">[fig:Cluster Method
Comparision]</a>. The bar plots are identical with cluster 1 and 2
interchanged. Also this is evident from cluster visualization with 2
features in figure <a href="#fig:Cluster Visualization"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Cluster Visualization">[fig:Cluster
Visualization]</a>, Only colors of cluster 1 and 2 are interchanged. The
number of customers were also almost same for each segments in both
methods.</p>
<p>In terms of time complexity HC took significantly higher time than
KMeans since HC is connectivity based clustering. It grows as
O(n*n).</p>

Recommendations</h1>
<h2 id="actionable-insights">Actionable insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>There are three customers segment for the credit service at
AllLife Bank. Let’s call them A, B and C.</p></li>
<li><p>Segment A comprise more than 50 % of customers. They are more
likely to visit Bank in person and hold up to 6 or 7 credit cards. Their
median credit limit is round 30,000.</p></li>
<li><p>Segemt B consists of 7.5 % of total customers. They make very
less phone calls or visit in person. They make higher activity in online
mode. Hold higher number of cards and credit limits are usually very
high reaching up to 200,000.</p></li>
<li><p>Segment C consists of around 34 % of total customers. They make
higher number of phone calls for the services. They have at most 4
credit cards in possession and median credit limit is very less around
12,000.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-recommendations">Business Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The mode of communication for their queries is very distinct in
three customer segments we found. Customer service should be fine
tailored to adapt to these communication modes (phones, in person and
online).</p></li>
<li><p>Segment A is the largest. Yet most of them visit bank in person.
If we could improve online mode or encourage them to use online mode, we
could profit from this segment as higher usage of online mode is
correlated with more credit cards.</p></li>
<li><p>Section C has 34 % of total yet they have comparatively few
credit cards and limits. Incentives could be offered to customers in
these segment to promote credit service. Since they prefer phone calls
for query, customer care department should be trained to understand this
segment better during calls and could also make some promotions towards
call end.</p></li>
<li><p>Segment B only makes 7.5 % yet they are biggest users in terms of
amount. Since they prefer online modes we need to make sure that their
user experience is seamless during website or app visit. They have
usually high number of credit cards. We need to make sure that apps or
websites make access to their card portfolios easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Robust Feed backs mechanism should be developed in all the above
modes to address all the three segments and understand if they were
satisfied in the customer support.</p></li>
<li><p>The three cluster could be used to identify new incoming
customers and serve them accordingly. Simply record their prefer mode of
communication, credit limit and number of cards they start to
acquire.</p></li>
