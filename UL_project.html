    <h2>Unsupervised Learning Project:</h3>
    <h3>Topic:ALLLIFE BANK CREDIT CARD 
        CUSTOMER SERVICE CASE STUDY.
    </h3>
    <p>AllLife Bank aims to enhance its credit card customer base in the upcoming financial year. Insights
        from the marketing research team suggest that market penetration can be improved. Consequently,
        the Marketing team plans to launch personalized campaigns targeting new customers and upselling
        to existing ones. Additionally, market research revealed that customers perceive the bankâ€™s support
        services poorly. In response, the Operations team intends to upgrade the service delivery model to
        ensure faster resolution of customer queries. Both the Head of Marketing and Head of Delivery have
        decided to seek assistance from the Data Science team to achieve these goals.
        As a data scientist at AllLife Bank, my objective is to identify distinct customer segments based on
        their spending patterns and past interactions with the bank. By employing clustering algorithms, I aim
        to uncover meaningful insights that will enable the bank to tailor its marketing strategies and enhance
        customer service. My recommendations will focus on how to effectively target new customers and up
        sell to existing ones, ensuring a more personalized and efficient approach to customer engagement.</p>
