<h1 id="breaking-strength-of-cement-packaging-gunny-bags">Breaking
strength of cement packaging gunny bags</h1>
<p>The breaking strength of gunny bags used for packaging cement follows
a normal distribution, with a mean of 5 kg per square centimeter and a
standard deviation of 1.5 kg per square centimeter. To better understand
potential wastage or pilferage within the supply chain, the quality team
of the cement company is seeking answers to several key questions
regarding the packaging material. They want to determine the percentage
of gunny bags that have a breaking strength below certain critical
thresholds, which could indicate a higher risk of breakage during
handling or transport. Additionally, the team is interested in knowing
the probability that a randomly selected bag exceeds a specific breaking
strength, helping them gauge the robustness of their packaging. By
analyzing these aspects, the quality team can make more informed
decisions to minimize risks and optimize the supply chain’s
efficiency.</p>

<h1 id="zingaro-stone-printing-company">Zingaro stone printing
company</h1>
<p>Zingaro Stone Printing is a company specializing in printing images
or patterns on both polished and unpolished stones. For optimal printing
quality, the stone surface must have a Brinell hardness index of at
least 150. Recently, Zingaro received a new batch of polished and
unpolished stones from its clients. The company needs to assess these
stones to ensure they meet the required hardness standard, ensuring the
prints are of the good quality.</p>
<p>The data set provided to us has two columns representing Unpolished
and polished stones brinell hardness record. We have total 75 records
for each and we did not find any missing or irregular values in the data
set. The unpolished stones have a sample mean of 134 with standard
deviation of 33 and the polished stones have a sample mean of around 148
with standard deviation of 15. To address the following business
questions we will carry out hypothesis testing to get inference from the
sample data on the population of manufactured stones.</p>
<h2
id="zingaro-has-reason-to-believe-that-the-unpolished-stones-may-not-be-suitable-for-printing.-is-zingaro-justified-in-thinking-so">Zingaro
has reason to believe that the unpolished stones may not be suitable for
printing. Is Zingaro justified in thinking so?</h2>
<p>To answer this question we set up following hypothesis testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: Mean
hardness level of Unpolished stones is 150. <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>150.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate Hypothesis - <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> :
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> 150</p>
<p>We observe in the Figure <a href="#fig:stones-dist"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:stones-dist">5</a> that
hardness distribution of the sample is close to normal. We assume that
population distribution is normal. Hardness index is a continuous
variable and we do not know the population standard deviation. We
therefore carry out one sample t-test for population mean. The p value
was found to be 0.999 which is much higher than significance level 0.05.
We therefore do not have enough significance to reject the null
hypothesis and conclude that mean hardness index of Unpolished stones is
less than 150. We can also observe this in the sample distribution plot
in Figure <a href="#fig:stones-box" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stones-box">6</a> box plot. 75% of Unpolished stones
have hardness level below 160 and median value is below 140. Zingaro
company is justified ih their thought and should take action to improve
the hardness index of unpolished stones.</p></li>
</ul>

<img src="stone_hardness.png" id="fig:stones-box" />
</figure>
<h2
id="is-the-mean-hardness-of-the-polished-and-unpolished-stones-the-same">Is
the mean hardness of the polished and unpolished stones the same?</h2>
<p>Before setting up a hypothesis testing we can observe from Figure <a
href="#fig:stones-box" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:stones-box">6</a> that box plot for Treated and
polished stones is positioned a higher on y-axis than box plot for
unpolished stones. Graphically we already have a hint that means are not
equal. For statistical testing we employed the following null
hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : means
of hardness are equal for the polished and unpolished stones. <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{polished}\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{unpolished}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> :
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{polished}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{unpolished}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the sample standard deviations are different, the population
standard deviations may be assumed to be different. The data is
continuous and we assume that the populations are normally distributed.
We therefore could use two sample T-test for the population mean
comparison. The p value from the test statistics is found to be 0.0007
which is much less than level of significance 0.05. We therefore have
enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that means of
hardness are not equal for the polished and unpolished stones. The
polished stones have better hardness quality.</p>
<h1 id="dental-implants">Dental Implants</h1>

</div>
<p>The hardness of metal implants in dental cavities depends on multiple
factors, including the method of implantation, the temperature at which
the metal is treated, and the specific alloy used. Additionally, the
preferences and expertise of dentists, who may favor and excel in
particular methods, play a significant role. The variable of interest in
this context is the response, which refers to the hardness of the metal
implants. Understanding how these factors interact can help in
optimizing implant procedures and improving patient outcomes. Figure <a
href="#fig:dataset" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dataset">[fig:dataset]</a> show a glimpse of data
set used for the statistical analysis. We have four categorical columns
Dentist, Method, Alloy and Temp which will be treated as
factors/level/treatment variables. The Response column is the outcome or
dependent variable. During data cleaning we did not find any null or
missing values. We have five Dentist category 1 to 5. Two types of
alloys and three types of methods. There are three temperatures
settings.</p>
<h2
id="how-does-the-hardness-of-implants-vary-depending-on-dentists">How
does the hardness of implants vary depending on dentists?</h2>
<div class="wrapfigure">
<p><span>R</span><span>0.6</span> <img src="4_1.png" style="width:60.0%"
alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>We are interested in effective hardness of implants with respect to
different dentist. For this we have put box plots of Response variable
with respect to dentist for two alloys in Figure <a href="#fig:4.1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:4.1">[fig:4.1]</a>. We
observe that dentist 5 has higher variability in hardness of implants
than other dentists. We are interested in figuring out whether the
differences in mean hardness level for different dentist is because of
intra-variance or the differences between them. So we need to carry out
a statistical test if the mean levels of all these dentist are equal. We
can therefore invoke the one way ANOVA F-test here which does the exact
task. We do the analysis for both types of Alloy. We did the
Shapiro-Wilk’s test to check normality condition and Levene test to
check equality of variance on the response variable. For both alloys
Normality condition is found to be not valid and equality of variance
condition is found to be valid. So the homogenity of variance assumpton
is verified using Levene’s test. Even though Shapiro-Wilk’s test is
failed we will assume that normality assumption holds and go forward
with the test. The hypothesis being set up is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : means
of hardness level in dental implants are equal across the dentist from 1
to 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> :
At least one mean value is different for some dentist among 1 to
5.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For alloy 1 we found the p-value to be 0.116 and for alloy 2 it is
found to be 0.718. So in both the cases we do not have enough
statistical evidence to reject null hypothesis with respect to
significance level of 5%. We conclude that mean hardness level is same
for all the dentist in both the alloys. We can intuitively see it from
the figure <a href="#fig:4.1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:4.1">[fig:4.1]</a> that all the box plots are more
or less on the same level. So, speaking on average it does not matter
which dentist performs the dental implant. Nevertheless it is important
to note that dentist 5 has higher spread than others and there are
outliers in the box plots.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-hardness-of-implants-vary-depending-on-methods">How
does the hardness of implants vary depending on methods?</h2>
<p>We have put a box plot on Figure <a href="#fig:4.2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:4.2">7</a> of Response
variable with respect to method used for implants for both alloy 1 and
2. We observe that Method 1 and Method 2’s box plot are on similar level
where as Method 3 seems to differ and is distinctively below. So
graphically we have a hint that method used for dental implant has
effect on hardness. Method 1 and 2 seem to provide better hardness
result than method 3 in both alloys. We need to carry out statistical
test to compare the mean levels across different method used. We
performed one way ANOVA F-test. We do te analysis for both types of
alloy separately. We did the Shapiro-Wilk’s test to check normality
condition and Levene test to check equality of variance on the response
variable. For both the alloys these assumption test failed. But owing to
the importance of ANOVA test we proceed to carry out the test on sample
data. The hypothesis being set up is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : means
of hardness level in dental implants are equal across the methods from 1
to 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> :
At least one mean value is different for some method among 1 to
3.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The p value from one way F-test is found to be very small compared to
significance level of 5% in both alloy types. We therefore in both the
cases reject the null hypothesis and conclude that means of hardness
level is not same across the method used for implants. To find out which
one differ we carried out multiple pairwise comparison test (Turkey
HSD). We found that mean for method 3 is different from 1 and 2 in both
types of alloys. This agrees with our graphical observation in figure <a
href="#fig:4.2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:4.2">7</a>. The results from Turkey HSD are shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:hsd" data-reference-type="ref"

What is the interaction effect between the dentist and method on the

<p>We have put an interaction plot on Response variable between method
and dentist in Figure <a href="#fig:interaction-plot"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:interaction-plot">10</a>.
On the x axis we have three methods and different colored curve is
plotted for all the dentist from 1 to 5. Each point represent mean of
the sample corresponding to the method and dentist combination. The
error bars are omitted for better visibility. We have done the analysis
separately for alloy 1 and 2. In the previous question we had discovered
that method 3 has lower hardness result compared to other methods. this
is also reflected in this interaction plot. For most dentist combination
the mean hardness level for method 3 has lower response value. If higher
hardness level is desired then dentists not performing well in method 3
should consider their options more towards method 1 and 2.<br />

does the hardness of implants vary depending on dentists and methods

<p>For addressing this question we will use two-way ANOVA test. It is
used to examine the interaction effect between two independent variables
(factors) on a single dependent variable. Here we have two factors
Method and Dentist. The dependent variable is Hardness level i.e
Response. The following are the hypothesis design for the test.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hypothesis for main effect of Method factor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : Method
used for implant doe not have any effect on Response level.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> : Method used
for implant does have effect on Response level.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis for main effect of Dentist factor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> :
Different dentist get same result on Response level.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> : Different
dentist get variable result on Response level.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hypothesis for interaction effect</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Null Hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : There
is no interaction between Method and Dentist on Response level.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternate <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> : There is an
interaction between Method and Dentist on Response level.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:two-way-anova" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:two-way-anova">[fig:two-way-anova]</a> shows the
test result table for two way ANOVA on both typre of alloys. The last
column indicates the p-value for the test statistics. We see that p
value is 0.0114 and 0.3718 for Dentist factor in alloy 1 and 2
respectively. Which is larger than our accepted significance level of
5%. We therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis for Dentist factor.
Therefore, on average different dentist get same result on hardness
level. The p value for Method factor in alloy 1 is 0.0002 which very
small compared to significance level. In this case null hypothesis is
rejected and we conclude that method of implant has efect on hardness
level in alloy 1. Similarly, The p value for Method factor in alloy 2 is
close to zero, null hypothesis is rejected and we conclude that method
of implant has significant effect on hardness level in alloy 2. For the
interaction between Method and Dentist factor, we find p value to be
0.0067. We have enough statistical evidence for the null hypothesis for
interaction effect in alloy1 to be rejected. With respect to
significance level of 5% we conclude that there is interaction between
method and dentist on response variable. We also observed this
qualitatively in previous question where we discussed the interaction
plot in Figure <a href="#fig:interaction-plot" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:interaction-plot">10</a>. In case of alloy 2 the p
value for interaction term is 0.093. Although we do not reject null
hypothesis here with respect to significance level of 5%, we can
conclude that there is 90.7% chance of interaction effect to be true. So
interaction between method and dentist factor in alloy 2 can not be
ignored.</p>
